# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.1.0-SNAPSHOT] - 2026-03-19

### Fixed
- **N2N/N2C socket scoping** — listeners used `evalMap` + `.start` which released the fs2 socket scope immediately, killing connections. Fixed with `map` + `parJoin` to keep socket alive for the handler's lifetime
- **Mux frame segmentation** — `MuxDemuxer.send`/`sendResponse` sent entire payloads in one frame. The mux wire format uses a 16-bit length field (max 65535 bytes); Shelley+ blocks exceeding 65KB caused length overflow and silent stream corruption. Fixed by segmenting large payloads across multiple frames under the write lock (receive-side reassembly already existed)
- **BlockFetch/ChainSync server height lookup** — `findHeight` did a linear reverse scan capped at 10k blocks from tip; couldn't find older blocks. Added `point_to_height` RocksDB column family for O(1) point→height reverse lookups

### Changed

### Added
- **Ouroboros Praos consensus module** — full 4-phase implementation:
  - **Phase 1: Crypto primitives + block model** — Ed25519 verification (BouncyCastle), VRF verification via libsodium/JNA (lazy-loaded, graceful fallback), extended ShelleyHeader with VRF certs, OCert, KES signature, protocol version, raw header body capture for KES verification
  - **Phase 2: Header validation** — 7-step validation per Shelley formal spec (pool lookup, KES period bounds, OCert Ed25519 verify, KES signature verify, VRF key hash match, VRF proof verify, leader election threshold); fixed-point Taylor series leader check avoiding floating point
  - **Phase 3: Epoch state** — epoch nonce evolution (Blake2b-256 accumulation with stability window freeze), three-snapshot stake pipeline (mark/set/go rotation), OCert counter monotonicity, full ConsensusState tracking
  - **Phase 4: Chain selection** — longest chain rule with OCert counter and VRF output tiebreakers, security window (k=2160) fork filtering, block immutability check
- **Standalone KES library** (`modules/kes/`, package `cardano.kes`) — CompactSum6KES verification in pure Scala, binary Merkle tree over Ed25519 keys (6 levels, 64 periods), designed for extraction as independent open-source JVM library; deps: BouncyCastle + scodec-bits only
- **VrfCert, OperationalCert, VrfResult** types — era-specific VRF handling (TPraos: dual nonce+leader certs; Praos: single cert), full OCert fields (hotVkey, counter, startKesPeriod, coldSignature)
- **BlockDecoder consensus fields** — now parses VRF certs, OCerts, KES signatures, protocol versions from all Shelley+ era headers; captures raw header body CBOR for KES verification

- **Prometheus metrics endpoint** — `/metrics` in Prometheus text format via http4s, enabled with `--metrics-port <port>`:
  - Chain metrics: `stretto_chain_tip_slot`, `stretto_chain_tip_block`, `stretto_peer_tip_slot/block`, `stretto_sync_blocks_total`, `stretto_sync_bytes_total`, `stretto_sync_rollbacks_total`, `stretto_epoch`
  - `stretto_chain_density` — ratio of blocks to slots (expected ~0.05 on mainnet), matching Haskell node's `fragmentChainDensity`
  - `stretto_sync_progress` — 0.0 to 1.0 sync completion
  - `stretto_n2n_peers_connected`, `stretto_n2c_clients_connected`, `stretto_keepalive_rtt_ms`
  - Full JVM metrics: heap/non-heap memory, threads, GC collection time/count, uptime, system load, available processors
- **N2N server** — accept inbound N2N peer connections, enabling stretto-to-stretto chaining:
  - **N2N Handshake responder** — server-side version negotiation for N2N versions 11-14
  - **N2N ChainSync server** — serve era-wrapped headers from RocksDB to downstream peers, with cursor tracking and Topic subscription for tip-following
  - **BlockFetch server** — serve full blocks from RocksDB on MsgRequestRange, with range streaming (MsgStartBatch → MsgBlock* → MsgBatchDone)
  - **KeepAlive responder** — echo MsgKeepAliveResponse for incoming pings
  - **N2N TCP listener** — accept inbound N2N connections with Semaphore-gated max peers (default 16)
  - **CLI** — `--n2n-port <port>` and `--max-n2n-peers <n>` flags for relay command (disabled by default)

### Fixed
- **ChainSync tip-following stall** — pipelined sync would stall for ~33min after reaching tip because 99 remaining in-flight requests each required a new block (~20s). Root cause: fixed 100-request window with no tip-proximity awareness. Fix: adaptive pipelining that compares each response's slot with the peer's tip slot; when within 600 slots (~10min), stops sending replacement requests, naturally draining the window to 0 before hitting MsgAwaitReply. Also fixed drain error handling (old `case _ => None` could corrupt protocol state). On reconnect near tip, the window now shrinks immediately instead of firing 100 requests into a 0-block gap.

### Changed
- **ShelleyHeader** extended with 6 new fields: vrfResult, ocert, protocolVersion, kesSignature, rawHeaderBody (was: only blockNo/slotNo/prevHash/issuerVkey/vrfVkey/bodySize/bodyHash)
- **build.sbt** — added `kes` standalone module, JNA dependency for VRF/libsodium, consensus depends on kes

### Testing
- 403 tests total (394 passing, 9 ignored integration tests), up from 322
- Consensus: 51 tests (leader check math, VRF input construction, header validation pipeline, epoch nonce evolution, stake snapshot rotation, OCert monotonicity, chain selection)
- KES: 13 tests (depth 1 & 2 sign/verify, wrong period/message/VK rejection, size validation)
- Crypto: 9 tests (Ed25519 sign/verify roundtrip, wrong key/sig/size rejection, Blake2b-256)
- Serialization: 8 new tests (VRF cert parsing, OCert fields, KES signature, protocol version, raw header body across all Shelley+ eras)

- **Protocol parameters** — `ProtocolParameters` per era (Byron through Conway) with minFeeA/B, minUtxoValue, coinsPerUtxoByte, maxTxSize
- **BlockApplicator** — now runs validation during block application (permissive mode: logs errors, continues processing)
- **UTxO state & block applicator** — `UtxoState` (unspent output map), `BlockApplicator` applies blocks to UTxO (removes spent inputs, adds new outputs), works across all eras, 13 tests
- **Block model & decoder** — ADTs for all eras (Byron EBB, Byron main, Shelley through Conway) with CBOR decoder supporting indefinite-length encoding, tx hash computation via blake2b256
- **Block decoder conformance tests** — 15 tests using Pallas (Rust) test fixtures, verified tx counts, tx hashes, and fees across all 7 eras

- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions with formatting checks and test suite

### Fixed
- **Mux write contention** — add `Semaphore` to serialize concurrent socket writes from ChainSync + BlockFetch, preventing frame interleaving
- **KeepAlive client (initiator)** — TCP connection initiator now correctly sends periodic MsgKeepAlive pings (default 10s, configurable via `--keep-alive-interval`), preventing peer timeout disconnections. Previous implementation was a responder waiting for pings that never arrived.
- **Byron header hash** — prepend `0x82 + sub_tag` before hashing to match cardano-ledger-byron's `wrapBoundaryBytes`/`wrapHeaderBytes`
- **Preview network** — extend handshake to propose version 14 (preview nodes require v14+)

### Testing
